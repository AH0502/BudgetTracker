# Budget Tracker

This project allows the user to keep track of their budget. Users can add incomes and expenses. I wanted to create software that I thought would be useful and to learn how to program using **C#/.NET**. 

## Tech Stack
* C#/.NET
* Visual Studio Code

1. Data Persistance
    - In order to make this application *actually* useful, I need to implement data persistance. I'm going to implement a feature that allows users to export their data to a file such as a .csv or JSON. 
2. Transaction Categorization 
    - I'm planning to implement a category class which will allow users to group income and expenses by categories such as: Job, Rent, Groceries, etc.
