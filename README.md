# Budget Tracker

This project allows the user to keep track of their budget. Users can add incomes and expenses. I wanted to create software that I thought would be useful and to learn how to program using **C#/.NET**. 

## Tech Stack
* C#/.NET

1. Transaction Categorization 
    - I'm planning to implement a category class which will allow users to group income and expenses by categories such as: Job, Rent, Groceries, etc.
